# Data Clean Up


# Questions to Answer after training models

* Who are the highest value players?  Players the model thinks should be paid more than they actually are.  What teams has the most value, the least.  

* Regular Stats vs Advanced Stats.  Does including advanced stats in the model make them perform significantly more accurately?  

# Explore Data

* Covariance Plots, Violin/Histogram plots

# Model to do

* Normalize, standardize data?
* Variable Selection
