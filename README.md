# NBA Salary Prediction

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in the United States. With 210.2 million followers across all social media platforms, it is one of the most popular sport games in the world. Fans in the United States spend hundreds of dollars watching NBA games in the stadiums which creates revenue for the teams to pay the salary to obtain existing players or trade potential players from other teams. Thus, the salaries of the players is one of the hottest topics on social media and the news. 

In this final project, we will use past and current playersâ€™ demographic and regular season performance data to analyze the parameters and come up with models that can best predict the salaries of the players. The data set will be split into training and testing data sets and utilize K-Fold cross validation. We will be building multiple linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), random forest, and ensemble methods such as AdaBoosting models based on the training data set. The testing data set will be used to examine the accuracy or testing error of the models.  

We have concluded that the random forest is the best performing model and the SVM is the worst performing model. In addition, we identified the overpaid and underpaid players and explained the difference between predictions and their salaries by the actual trading situations.
