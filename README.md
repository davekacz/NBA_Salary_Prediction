# NBA Salary Prediction

Georgia Tech ISyE 7406 DMSL Final Project

I've created 2 main datasets.  

### 2017 - 2021 Dataset
Almost all clean data, few missing advanced stats, most likely can be replaced by 0 values.  Need to investigate. 

### 2013 - 2021 Dataset
Missing lots of advanced stats in earlier seasons.  Remove advanced stats from analysis?  Can probably calculate some of the stats based on available stats.  Need to investigate.

### To Do
Deal with categorical variables.  

How to handle 2020 covid season, numbers are low.  Drop season?  Change all values across dataset to per game?  

How to handle current partial season data.
